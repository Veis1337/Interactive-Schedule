# Interactive-Schedule

## Description

This project is an interactive schedule that can be used to store events for each timeblock of a typical workday.  The page welcomes you with the current day/date, and shows a list of timeblocks 9am-5pm and color coordinates past, present, and future based on the current time. 
The motivation behind this project was to practice using third-party-API's, as well as more practice on using localStorage and manipulating the DOM.   
I learned that third-party-API's can be crucial in the world of web dev in saving time and efficiency, as I have written almost this exact project before using just HTML and CSS and it spanned many many more lines of code than this time around.

Open the index.html file in a browser, or navigate to https://veis1337.github.io/Interactive-Schedule.html
Click on a time block and type in whatever event you want saved for that slot, and click the save button next to it!  The event will be saved so that you can revisit the page and still have it appear.
